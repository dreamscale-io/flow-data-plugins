[red] flip to yellow causes [yellow] to be a container.
[red] flip to blue causes [blue] to be a container.


When [in-a-container] state:

* toggling the container button to off, ends the [in-a-container] state.
* new conflicts will be part of the container when in the [in-a-container] state.
* when in a nested conflict, if the container is closed, the conflict is not considered part of the container. 

When in conflict, [red-nested yellow], [red-nested blue] icons appear (can go into container state, in a non-nested conflict)
Toggled on [red-nested yellow] - now I can do conflicts on top [red] on top [blue] - (in a yellow container state)
When I end the [red-nested yellow], my icon goes back to plain [yellow]. - (not in a container state)

When blue is toggled on, the blue icon turns to a [blue container] to show that rework and conflict bands will go inside the container.
When yellow is toggled on, the yello icon turns to a [yellow container] to show that learning and conflict bands will go inside the container.


Tooltips:

* Rework the problem (start rework container)
* Learn a new strategy (start learning container)

* End container - End rework/learning for "why is conflict question?"

Timeline:

getSequencedTimeline() 
Mixed list of TimeEntry objects sorted by time, excluding activity detail.  Should include all events, timebands, and containers in start-time-order.  Each container should include a time-sequenced list of the same objects that appear within the container period.  

getSequencedTimelineDetail()
Mixed list of TimeEntry objects from above that also includes activity detail and idle time.  Activity detail that corresponds to a container period should be within the container.

getConflictGroups()
Get list of all conflict containers and unnested conflicts (to be sorted in duration desc order). All objects should have the "conflict" api - question, answer, duration.  

TimePosition getEnd()
Get the end of the timeline (last activity detail + duration)
